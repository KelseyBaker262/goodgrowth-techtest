# GoodGrowth Tech Test

### Introduction
This repository contains my solution to the technical test provided by GoodGrowth. The aim of the test is to add weather information to the National Trust property information pages. This readme includes the implementation plan and a non-technical overview of the solution.



### Overview for a Non-Technical Audience
To enhance the visitor experience, I have added a feature to display the current weather for each National Trust property on their information pages. This allows visitors to plan their trips better, potentially increasing visitation rates. 

Using JavaScript, the code fetches and displays weather data for the propertyâ€™s location without altering the existing website structure. Also, there is an A/B test to show the weather information to a random half of the visitors and measure the impact on visitor behavior.
